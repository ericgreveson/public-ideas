    <h1>Optimization Illustrated</h1>
    <blockquote>
      <q>In mathematics, computer science, economics, or management science, mathematical optimization (alternatively, optimization
      or mathematical programming) is the selection of a best element (with regard to some criteria) from some set of available
      alternatives</q> - <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_optimization">Wikipedia, yesterday</a>
    </blockquote>
    <p>What is optimization all about? Essentially, optimization is the process of finding the &ldquo;best&rdquo; value of something.
    For example, if we're trying to make a drinks can, the <i>best</i> solution might be the cheapest one that can
    withstand the pressure from the fizzy drink (and the occasional droppage). If we're making a pressurized fuselage for an aircraft,
    the <i>best</i> solution might be the one with the lightest weight whilst being strong enough, regardless of cost. If we're
    designing a cardboard box, we might want to figure out which shape of box can hold the most stuff while using the least amount
    of cardboard.</p>

    <h2>Some terminology</h2>
    <p>To solve quantitative problems, we need to define an <strong>objective function</strong> that describes what is &ldquo;best&rdquo;
    in terms of the <strong>parameters</strong> of the problem. Let's call this objective function \(f\), and let's call the parameters
    \(\mathbf{x}\) (note that \(\mathbf{x}\) is a <i>vector</i>, unless we're just looking at an objective function with a single parameter, in which case
    we can call it \(x\) instead). Therefore, in general, our objective function is \(f(\mathbf{x})\), i.e. a scalar function with a vector parameter. By convention, we say that the &ldquo;best&rdquo; value of the
    objective function is the <i>minimum</i>. If we happen to have some metric where larger values are &ldquo;better&rdquo;, we can
    easily turn this into a standard objective function simply by taking the negative value of the function (or if we know all values
    in the metric function are positive, we could equivalently choose its reciprocal as the objective).</p>

    <h2>An example</h2>
    <p>In our cardboard box example, the parameters of shape are</p>
    <ul>
      <li>width, \(w\)</li>
      <li>height, \(h\)</li>
      <li>depth, \(d\)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We want <i>the highest box volume per amount of cardboard used</i>. As previously stated, by convention, our objective function
    should have its best value at a minimum, so we can rephrase this as <i>the lowest amount of cardboard per unit volume</i>.
    As volume \(V = w h d\), and area of cardboard \(A = 2 w h + 2 w d + 2 h d\) (i.e. a closed six-sided box), then</p>
    <p>$$objective = \frac{A}{V} = \frac{2 ( w h + w d + h d )}{w h d}$$</p>
    <p>We'll come back to this example later, as you can see that it's already hard to visualize this problem due to the three
    parameters (we can do a standard 2D plot for one parameter, and a surface plot or heatmap for 2 parameters, but plotting a
    function of three variables is not easy). Instead, we will start out with one of the easiest problems possible.</p>

    <h2>A simple function</h2>
    <p>The simplest type of problem occurs when the objective function has just one parameter (a <strong>one-dimensional</strong>
    or <strong>1-D</strong> problem). Let's call our one parameter \( x \) (well, it makes the graphs easier to understand, at least).
    For a simple objective function in \( x \) with a single minimum, let's go with</p>
    <p>$$f(x) = x^2$$</p>
    <p>At this point, you might be wondering if I've been mis-selling the &ldquo;Illustrated&rdquo; part. Well, that's fair enough,
    so here's an illustration of our simple objective function:</p>
    <div id="simple-function-chart" class="chart"></div>
    <p>Yay.</p>
    <p>It should be obvious that the minimum (and therefore optimum - remember our convention) is the point at \( (0, 0) \) - that is,
    \(x = 0\) and \(f(x) = x^2 = 0\). We can see this because we are humans with eyes (and a bit of maths knowledge). However, in
    general, our eyes are not going to be much use (did you try to visualize the three-parameter problem with the cardboard box?)
    and so we need to use numerical methods.</p>

    <h3>First approach: Analytic</h3>
    <p>We can start with an analytic approach. If you've done calculus (differentiation and integration), you might remember that
    the minimum of a function has \(\frac{\mathrm d f}{\mathrm d x} = 0\) (the gradient is flat) and
    \(\frac{\mathrm d^2 f}{\mathrm d x^2} \gt 0 \) (the function is increasing). Look at the graph above, and you will see that
    both of these are true at \( (0, 0) \). If we didn't have the graph, however, we could run through the maths as follows:</p>
    <p>$$\frac{\mathrm d f}{\mathrm d x} = 2 x = 0 \Rightarrow x = 0$$</p>
    <p>$$\frac{\mathrm d f}{\mathrm d x} = 2 x = 0 \Rightarrow x = 0$$</p>
    <p>Great. So this is all fine, but we will have a problem with the analytic approach when the objective functions become a bit
    more complicated. Imagine trying to do this with a function in hundreds of parameters, for example... even with a fancy
    software package like <a href="http://www.wolfram.com/mathematica/">Mathematica</a>, you'd quickly run into trouble.</p>

    <h3>Second approach: Sampling</h3>
    <p>An easy thing to try with a computer is simply to sample the function and then pick the parameter with the lowest objective
    function value. This approach depends on some new <i>tuning parameters</i> (that is, parameters associated with the solver
    approach, rather than the problem itself). For this 1-D problem, we need to decide on three tuning parameters: the start of
    the sampling range, the sampling step size, and the number of samples (or equivalently, the end of the sampling range). Let's
    start off by cheating, and selecting the values of these tuning parameters based on looking at the graph:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Start of range, \( \alpha = -1 \)</li>
      <li>End of range, \( \beta = 1 \)</li>
      <li>Sample step size, \( \delta = 0.1 \)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Since this is now a <i>bona fide</i> solver technique that we could implement on a computer, let's implement it on a computer
    (in JavaScript, since this is the Internet):</p>

    <p>If we had more parameters in the problem, we would need another three of these tuning parameters for each additional dimension.
